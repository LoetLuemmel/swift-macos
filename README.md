# Swift Programming for macOS

:apple: :computer:

There are plenty of books, videos, and online resources for developing iOS apps. Despite the fact that iPhone and iPad apps require a Mac for code development, there is very little information about actually creating native Mac applications. The examples in this repository demonstrate various aspects of Mac app development using the latest versions of Swift and SwiftUI. Hopefully the examples and accompanying website will provide a useful resource for Mac developers.
